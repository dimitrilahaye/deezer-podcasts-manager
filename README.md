# Deezer Podcasts Manager

Now that Deezer doesn't allow us to download podcasts anymore, I have no way to manage my daily playlist (I listen to more than 50 podcasts ðŸ˜±).

So I created a PWA app to list my favorite podcasts and create my playlist through publications.

No login required, data is persisted locally with IndexedDB ðŸš€
